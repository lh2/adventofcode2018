# Advent of Code 2018

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2018.

The aoc.sh helper script takes care of downloading the inputs and running the
tasks. Create a file called "session.txt" and fill it with your AoC session ID
so it can download your personalized inputs.

Example: `./aoc.sh 3 1`

For the first task of day 3.

## TODO

- I am not quite sure if the whole code generation thing is brilliant or stupid
- Make it so that task functions can also accept slices instead of channels, as
  this is a common usecase
